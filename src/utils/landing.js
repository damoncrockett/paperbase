        text: `Throughout the twentieth century, photography was fundamentally a paper-based medium, and photographic papers have played a crucial role in shaping the medium's history and practice. However, little research has been done on how the material, technical, and visual properties of these papers impacted the work of photographers. This lack of scholarly attention stems partly from the difficulty of accessing and analyzing the physical characteristics of historical photographic papers.`

        text: `To address this gap, the Lens Media Lab at Yale University's Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage has undertaken an extensive project to document and characterize its collection of over 7,500 dated and identified gelatin silver papers manufactured between 1890 and 2010. This is believed to be the largest collection of photographic paper samples in the world. Roughly one-third of the samples in the collection come from packages of photographic paper; the remaining two-thirds come from sample books published by manufacturers, and most of the samples in these books are printed photographs. From this collection, the lab has constructed a rich and comprehensive dataset that combines traditional catalog information with extensive material analyses.`

        text: `The dataset includes, for each paper sample, detailed measurements of surface texture, gloss, base color, image color, thickness, and fluorescence to delineate the wide material variety of papers used by both professional and amateur photographers during the twentieth century. Also recorded for each paper sample are the manufacturer, brand, surface code, spatial dimensions, and year of manufacture (sometimes estimated or inferred); any resin coatings, toning agents, backprints, and processing instructions; and any language used by the manufacturer to describe the material properties that we measure: texture terms like “smooth”, “rough”, and “pebbled”; color terms like “white”, “cream”, and “ivory”; reflectance terms like “glossy”, “matte”, and “luster”; and designations of paper thickness, usually “single weight” or “double weight”. The lab has done extensive imaging of the collection as well, including microscopic images of the paper surfaces; high-resolution digital images of any paper packages, sample book photographs, and backprints; and scans of any processing instructions. This rich trove of data is now made publicly accessible through Paperbase, a new web-based research platform developed by the Lens Media Lab.`

        text: `By providing access to this unique dataset through Paperbase, the Lens Media Lab seeks to catalyze new approaches to characterizing the material practices of twentieth-century photographers. Moreover, Paperbase will enable researchers to chart the evolution of paper-based photographic technologies, such as the introduction of optical brightening agents and resin coatings, and to better understand how the language used to describe photographic papers, including widespread terms like “white” and “glossy,” changed over time.`
