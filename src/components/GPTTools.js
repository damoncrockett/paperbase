// There isn't a specific code snippet I can give you that will implement a paintbrush selection tool in three.js, but I can provide some guidance on how you could go about implementing this feature.

// First, you'll need to set up your three.js scene and add the objects you want to be able to select. Once you have that set up, you can add an event listener that listens for when the user clicks and drags the mouse. As the user moves the mouse, you can use the getIntersection method to check if the mouse is intersecting with any of the objects in your scene.

// When the user releases the mouse, you can then add the intersected objects to an array or a selection list. You can use this array to keep track of which objects are currently selected, and use it to apply any changes you want to make to the selected objects.

// Here is a rough example of how you could implement this:




// Set up your three.js scene and add your objects here

// Set up a variable to keep track of the mouse position
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

// Set up an array to store the selected objects
let selectedObjects = [];

// Set up an event listener that listens for mouse events
document.addEventListener('mousedown', onMouseDown, false);
document.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove, false);
document.addEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp, false);

function onMouseDown(event) {
  // Update the mouse position when the user clicks and starts dragging
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
  // Update the mouse position as the user moves the mouse
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
}

function onMouseUp(event) {
  // When the user releases the mouse, clear the selectedObjects array
  selectedObjects = [];

  // Use the `getIntersection` method to check if the mouse is intersecting with any objects in the scene
  let intersects = scene.getIntersection(mouse);

  // If there are any intersecting objects, add them to the selectedObjects array
  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    for (let i = 0; i < intersects.length; i++) {
      selectedObjects.push(intersects[i].object);
    }
  }
}

// This is just a basic example to give you an idea of how you could implement a paintbrush selection tool in three.js. There are many different ways you could modify this code to make it work for your specific use case. For example, you could add a "paintbrush" cursor to show the user where they are painting, or you could add additional controls to allow the user to deselect objects or clear their selection.


// Set up your three.js scene and add your objects here

// Set up a variable to keep track of the mouse position
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

// Set up an array to store the selected objects
let selectedObjects = [];

// Set up the radius of the paintbrush selection tool (increase this value to make the tool wider)
let brushRadius = 0.1;

// Set up an event listener that listens for mouse events
document.addEventListener('mousedown', onMouseDown, false);
document.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove, false);
document.addEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp, false);

function onMouseDown(event) {
  // Update the mouse position when the user clicks and starts dragging
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
  // Update the mouse position as the user moves the mouse
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
}

function onMouseUp(event) {
  // When the user releases the mouse, clear the selectedObjects array
  selectedObjects = [];

  // Use the `getIntersection` method to check if the mouse is intersecting with any objects in the scene
  let intersects = scene.getIntersection(mouse, brushRadius);

  // If there are any intersecting objects, add them to the selectedObjects array
  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    for (let i = 0; i < intersects.length; i++) {
      selectedObjects.push(intersects[i].object);
    }
  }
}


// Set up your three.js scene and add your objects here

// Set up an array to store the selected objects
let selectedObjects = [];

// Set up a variable to keep track of the mouse position
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();

// Set up a variable to store the points of the lasso path
let lassoPoints = [];

// Set up an event listener that listens for mouse events
document.addEventListener('mousedown', onMouseDown, false);
document.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove, false);
document.addEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp, false);

function onMouseDown(event) {
  // Update the mouse position and add it to the lassoPoints array when the user starts dragging
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
  lassoPoints.push(new THREE.Vector2(mouse.x, mouse.y));
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
  // Update the mouse position and add it to the lassoPoints array as the user moves the mouse
  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
  lassoPoints.push(new THREE.Vector2(mouse.x, mouse.y));
}

function onMouseUp(event) {
  // When the user releases the mouse, clear the selectedObjects array
  selectedObjects = [];

  // Close the lasso path by adding the first point to the end of the lassoPoints array
  lassoPoints.push(lassoPoints[0]);

  // Use the `getIntersection` method to check if the objects in the scene intersect with the lasso path
  let intersects = scene.getIntersection(lassoPoints);

  // If there are any intersecting objects, add them to the selectedObjects array
  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    for (let i = 0; i < intersects.length; i++) {
      selectedObjects.push(intersects[i].object);
    }
  }

  // Clear the lassoPoints array for the next selection
  lassoPoints = [];
